## Create ladder diagrams of ECG and EP recordings
EP Diagram is in alpha development.  The master branch won't be
updated fequently, at least until we get close to beta status.  Look
to the development branch to see what's happening.

The purpose of EP Diagram is to create ladder diagrams as they appear
in textbooks, but interactively on your phone or tablet.  We hope this
will be a useful teaching tool for cardiologists.  EP Studios is not
liable for any errors that might occur from using this app.
