EP Diagram
==========

## Create ladder diagrams of ECG and EP recordings
The purpose of EP Diagram is to create ladder diagrams as they appear
in textbooks, but interactively on your iOS phone or tablet (or M1
Mac).  We hope this will be a useful teaching tool for cardiologists
and medical students.  EP Studios is not liable for any errors that
might occur from using this app.

EP Diagram is in beta development.
