- *EP Diagram* creates /ladder diagrams/, a classic form of ECG analysis that depicts the path of the cardiac impulse through anatomic regions of the heart.  Ladder diagrams are useful to understand cardiac arrhythmias such as heart block, reentrant tachycardias, and premature complexes.  Traditionally ladder diagrams are roughly sketched on paper, but with *EP Diagram* you can draw them on your iPad, and, unlike a paper sketch, these diagrams can scroll and zoom, can measure intervals and conduction times automatically, and can be saved as publication quality images.

- *EP Diagram* has a lot of built-in features that simplify the creation of ladder diagrams, and these features are described in this help manual.  The next section, Quick start contains some tips on how to get started.  However a good way to learn the program is to create some sample ladder diagrams, then use your finger to tap, double-tap, and drag on the ladder to see what happens.  Try out the various buttons.  Experiment!  Most of the functions are intuitive, and if you want more in-depth instruction, have a look at the rest of this help manual.
