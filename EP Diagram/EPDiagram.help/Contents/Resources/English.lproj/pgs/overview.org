- *EP Diagram* creates /ladder diagrams/, a classic form of ECG analysis that depicts the path of the cardiac impulse through anatomic regions of the heart.  Ladder diagrams are useful to understand cardiac arrhythmias such as heart block, reentrant tachycardias, and premature complexes. They also can be used to draw the timing intervals, blanking periods, and refractory periods used by electronic pacemakers. Traditionally ladder diagrams are roughly sketched on paper, but with *EP Diagram* you can draw them on your Mac, and, unlike a paper sketch, these diagrams can be panned and zoomed, can be used to measure intervals and conduction times, and can be saved as publication quality images.

- *EP Diagram* has a lot of built-in features that simplify the creation of ladder diagrams.  [[./quick_start.html][Quick start]] contains some tips on how to get started.  However a good way to learn the program is to create some sample ladder diagrams, then click, double -click, or drag on the ladder to see what happens.  Try out the various buttons.  Experiment!  Most of the functions are intuitive, and if you want more in-depth instruction, have a look at the rest of this help manual.
