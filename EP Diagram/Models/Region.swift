// A Region is a collection of Marks, in left to right order.  Positions are

        /* Thus
         Mark -- Interval -- nil
         Mark -- Interval -- Mark -- Interval -- nil
         etc.
         Thus each Mark has an Interval attached to it, an each Interval has at least one Mark (the prior Mark),
         with possibly another Mark after it.
         Must deal with deleted Marks and Marks added  in between Marks.

         Consider an Array of [Any] (must use Any for structs, AnyObject is for classes only).
         Problem is the Array of Marks is not ordered, but in the order that the Marks are added.  So above won't
         work.  It looks like we will need to sort the Mark array based on proximal and distal x and add intervals
         on the fly in each region.  Only need to do with each addition and deletion and only in the affected region.
