/**
 The mark is a fundamental component of a ladder diagram.

 A mark can be many things, which makes the concept difficult to pin down.  It can be conduction through a region, with or without decrement.  Conduction can originate  in a region, at the top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle, or may originate in another region.  A mark can block or conduct. It can reenter, spawning another mark.

 After much back and forth on terminology, it seems that the two ends of a mark should be defined by the time axis.  Thus a mark always has one end that is theoretically earlier in time than the other.  These points are the *origin* and *terminus* of the mark.  Each of these points is defined by an x position in time (based on the unzzomed, non-offset ECG image) and a y position in the region.  The y position is not a specific location on the y axis, rather it is a float from 0 to 1.0, where 0 is the most proximal part of the region, and 1.0 is the most distal.  the LadderViewModel converts these point coordinates to actual coordinates, depending on the height of the regions and the zoom and offset factors of the ECG image.
