/// A mark is a line segment, defined by its two end points.  Marks may slant in different directions, depending on the origin of an impulse.  So rather than using origin and terminus (which could swap positions if the slant of the mark is changed), we use the same convention as with regions: the two ends are termed *proximal* and *distal*.i

/**
 The mark is a fundamental component of a ladder diagram.

 A mark can be many things, which makes the concept difficult to pin down.  It can be conduction through a region, with or without decrement.  Conduction can originate  in a region, at the top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle, or may originate in another region.  A mark can block or conduct. It can reenter, spawning another mark.
