// A Mark is the little line drawn on the ladder, such as the vertical line for
// atrial activation.  It isn't necessarily vertical, as in the AV region, so it
// has a start and end position.  The Mark only cares about its horizontal positioning;
// Regions care about vertical positioning.  A Mark represent the origin of an impulse.
// Presumably start and end positions are top to bottom.
